# 🚗 Car Fuel Efficiency Prediction

## 🎯 Objective
To build a regression-based machine learning model that predicts car fuel efficiency (in MPG) using various car features such as displacement, horsepower, weight, etc.

---

## 📘 Project Background

This project was part of a 5th semester internship with **Rubixe Datamite Pvt. Ltd.**, a company specializing in AI, data analytics, and machine learning. The goal was to gain hands-on experience in supervised machine learning using Python and to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world data.

The project is based on the **Auto MPG dataset**, and the task was to use regression modeling to predict a car’s fuel efficiency.

## 💡 Findings & Limitations

### ✅ Key Findings:
- Car weight, displacement, and horsepower are key predictors of MPG.
- Linear Regression provided good baseline performance.
- Visual analysis helped detect outliers and multicollinearity.

### ⚠️ Limitations:
- Dataset was relatively small (~398 records).
- Some features like "car name" were ignored.
- Model doesn't generalize to hybrid/electric vehicles.
